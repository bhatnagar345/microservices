Spring Boot Microservices Project

Overview

This project is a Spring Boot-based microservices architecture consisting of three microservices: Job, Company, and Review. The microservices are designed to work together, utilizing service registry, communication via OpenFeign, distributed tracing with Zipkin, externalized configuration using Config Server, and fault tolerance mechanisms including circuit breakers. The project also integrates PostgreSQL database and RabbitMQ for data management and messaging.
